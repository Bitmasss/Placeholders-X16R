Placeholders: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Artifact Storage System
Abstract.

A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic artifact storage would allow data to be sent directly from one party to another   without  the possibility of censorship.

Using technology outlined in Satoshi Nakamotos whitepaper, found here: https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf it is possible to attach a riding, neutral side blockchain that is attached via the security of public private key cryptography. The benefit is that it is possible to provide an authentic origin and modification history of data that is easy to verify and can be checksummed against its stated origin.
